Sodbox - Simple Object Database for XML
================================================================================

This is a fork of the Perst database. It's not a real fork but just a place to
experiment with some ideas. If you are interested in a Java object-oriented
database, I'd recommend you check out the Perst project instead of Sodbox. Perst
is a GNU GPL'ed database that can be found at http://www.mcobject.com/perst
